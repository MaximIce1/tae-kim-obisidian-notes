You can declare a noun or な-adjective with 「だ」(kinda an alternative of "to be" verb)
Examples:
	人**だ**　「hitoda」-  is person
	学生**だ**　「gakuseida」-  is student
	元気**だ**　「genkida」-  is well


**Though u can declare something is being it even without 「だ」**
(If context allows that)

Example of acceptable context for that is just a casual talk
	A:　元気？ -  ((Are you) well?)
	B: 　元気。

Though sometimes you have to use 「だ」、it makes sentence sound more serious, and sometimes it has to be used in some grammatical structures
